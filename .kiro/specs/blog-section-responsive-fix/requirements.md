# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The BlogSection component currently has scroll animation issues on different screen sizes, particularly on 1080p screens and mobile devices. The ScrollTrigger animation causes content overlap with the top section and visibility problems. This feature will fix the responsive behavior of the horizontal scroll animation to work seamlessly across all device sizes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the blog section on different screen sizes, I want the scroll animation to work properly without overlapping content, so that I can have a smooth browsing experience across all devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the blog section on desktop screens (1920px+) THEN the horizontal scroll animation SHALL work smoothly without content overlap
2. WHEN the user views the blog section on laptop screens (1080p and similar) THEN the animation SHALL not overlap with the previous section content
3. WHEN the user views the blog section on tablet devices (768px-1024px) THEN the scroll behavior SHALL be optimized for touch interaction
4. WHEN the user views the blog section on mobile devices (below 768px) THEN the horizontal scroll SHALL be replaced with a mobile-friendly alternative
5. IF the screen height is limited THEN the component SHALL adjust its height dynamically to prevent overflow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the BlogSection component, I want responsive breakpoints and dynamic calculations, so that the animation adapts automatically to different viewport sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component initializes THEN it SHALL detect the current viewport size and apply appropriate scroll behavior
2. WHEN the viewport is resized THEN the scroll animation SHALL recalculate and adjust accordingly
3. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the component SHALL use a simpler scroll mechanism or disable horizontal scrolling
4. IF the container height exceeds viewport height THEN it SHALL automatically adjust to fit within the visible area
5. WHEN the ScrollTrigger is active THEN it SHALL use responsive start/end points based on screen size

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on mobile devices, I want an optimized blog browsing experience, so that I can easily read and navigate through blog posts without animation conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the blog cards SHALL be displayed in a mobile-optimized layout
2. WHEN scrolling on mobile THEN the user SHALL have smooth native scrolling without GSAP interference
3. WHEN the screen width is below 768px THEN the horizontal scroll animation SHALL be disabled
4. IF touch gestures are detected THEN the component SHALL prioritize native mobile scrolling behavior
5. WHEN on mobile THEN the card sizing SHALL be optimized for smaller screens

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user experiencing the blog section animation, I want consistent performance across different screen resolutions, so that the visual experience is smooth regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the animation triggers THEN it SHALL use viewport-relative calculations instead of fixed values
2. WHEN the component is pinned THEN it SHALL maintain proper spacing from adjacent sections
3. WHEN scrolling through the animation THEN the timing SHALL be consistent across different screen sizes
4. IF the animation cannot complete properly THEN it SHALL gracefully fallback to a static layout
5. WHEN the animation ends THEN the component SHALL properly unpin and allow normal scrolling to resume
